## Use case

KML files can reference other KML files on the network and support automatically refreshing content. For example, survey workers will benefit from KML data shown on their devices automatically refreshing to show the most up-to-date state. Additionally, discovering KML files linked to the data they are currently viewing provides additional information to make better decisions in the field.

## How to use the sample

The sample will load the KML file automatically. The data shown should refresh automatically every few seconds. Tap the "Network Link Messages" button to view the messages. Pan and zoom to explore the map.

## How it works

1. Create a `KMLDataset` from a KML source that has network links.
2. Construct a `KMLLayer` with the dataset and add the layer to the scene as an operational layer.
3. To listen for network messages,  use the KML dataset's `networkLinkMessages`.
