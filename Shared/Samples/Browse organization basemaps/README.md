## Use case

Organizational basemaps are a Portal feature allowing organizations to specify basemaps for use throughout the organization. Customers expect that they will have access to their organization's standard basemap set when they connect to a Portal. Organizational basemaps are useful when certain basemaps are particularly relevant to the organization, or if the organization wants to make premium basemap content available to their workers.

## How to use the sample

You'll be prompted to provide a URL to your Portal, then sign in. After you sign in, you'll see a map and a list of basemaps to choose from. Select a basemap to use it in the map.

## How it works

1. Connect to a portal.
2. Get the list of basemaps for that portal.
