Create and use a raster layer made from a local raster file.

## Use case

Rasters can be digital aerial photographs, imagery from satellites, digital pictures, or even scanned maps. An end-user will frequently need to import raster files acquired through various data-collection methods into their map to view and analyze the data.

## How to use the sample

Upon launch, a raster will be loaded from a file and displayed in the map view. Pan and zoom to explore.

## How it works

1. Create a `Raster` from a raster file.
2. Create a `RasterLayer` from the raster.
3. Add the raster layer to the map's operational layers.
